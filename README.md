# 3D Printing Resources

This is a general collection of things useful for my 3D printers, including
collecting external information resources, documenting how various features work
and/or should be set up, and providing configuration/info for specific printers.

> _NOTE: all of this is specific to my setups; YMMV, you have been warned!_
